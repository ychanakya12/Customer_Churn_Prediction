# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using a Kaggle dataset (e.g., Telco Customer Churn). Built with Python in Jupyter Notebooks, it employs classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify at-risk customers. Features include data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SMOTE for class imbalance. The model achieves [insert metric, e.g., 85% accuracy or 0.82 F1-score] and provides insights for targeted retention strategies.
